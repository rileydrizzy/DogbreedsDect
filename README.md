# TEMPORARY README

This project aims to create a machine learning project that can identify dog breeds from images. With over 120 distinct breeds of dogs, this project embarks on a challenging journey of multiclassification, aiming to accurately categorize each image into its corresponding breed category. However, this task goes beyond mere classification, as the project also delves into the realm of multilabel prediction, recognizing that images may contain multiple dogs, each potentially belonging to different breeds. Moreover, we extend our exploration to encompass the domain of object detection, a facet that necessitates not only identifying the breed but also localizing the dog within the image. This convergence of multiclassification, multilabel prediction, and object detection showcases the project's comprehensive approach to unravelling the complexities of canine imagery, making strides towards more robust and versatile machine learning solutions
